TBAnnotationClustering
======================

Example project from [blog post](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-to-handle-large-amounts-of-data-on-maps/).

Quad Tree
---------
If you want to grab the quad tree you can get it from my [GitHub](https://github.com/theocalmes/TBQuadTree)

or just install using cocoapods

```pod 'TBQuadTree', '~> 0.0'```

Swift Version
--------------
A try to migrate the Objective-C code to Swift, which so far failed miserably.
This doesn't work yet - although all the code has been migrated, for some reason the gatherDataInRange method won't find anything.
